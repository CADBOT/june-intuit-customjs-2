Create at least 5 variables.
  - at least 2 of which are Numbers
  - at least 1 of which contains a decimal
  - at least 2 of which are strings

Do 4 math operations on the numbers.
Prove to yourself that decimal numbers aren't special
compared to integer numbers(i.e. you can add them together
without doing anything special)
